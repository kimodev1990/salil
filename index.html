                        I guess since my early college years I have been an addict of Salil's music. Of course in those
                        days buying and
                        collecting records was beyond my means. I started collecting his songs since the early '80s.
                        Since then I have been
                        painstakingly trying to collect Salil's songs, his poems, his short-stories, his plays, all his
                        films in video and
                        anything else I could get hold of, such as articles about him, reviews about his music,
                        interviews with him etc. I met
                        Salilda for the first time in the early '80s and since then I have been quite fortunate to meet
                        him regularly in India
                        and abroad and got to know him quite well. To me he was an inspiration, a teacher, a friend and
                        above all the most
                        talented and complete music director India ever had. He was also a wonderful person to be with.
                        Highly intelligent with
                        a wonderful sense of humour. His music filled my life with joy and made it richer. Salilda has
                        left us now but I tend to
                        believe that he has just moved to a distant address. Seems like I can still communicate with him
                        through his songs and
                        feel that he is still around us.

                        I decided to create this website in 1998, three years after our Salilda left us. This website is
                        primarily an archive
                        but it also gives me the opportunity to share his music with everybody else. A major update to
                        this website took place
                        in 2000 and since then it has been continually updated.

                        We are proud to announce the release of the latest album of Salilda's unpublished songs he
                        composed just before the
                        Bangladesh Independence. These songs were composed in around 1971 and are part of an unfinished
                        opera he was trying to
                        create. The spool tape was preserved by a Salil admirer for over 37 years and these songs were
                        recovered from that tape.
                        This album is now marketed by UD Industries of Kolkata, India. In India it can also be ordered
                        from Amazon.in. Please

                        After nearly 12 years of searching followed by hard work we re-discovered many songs composed by
                        Salil between 1944 to
                        1951. All of these songs were protest songs with strong political message. Salil called them
                        "Songs of Consciousness".
                        Some were recorded and most of us know those songs. But a large number of them were never
                        released or recorded. Most
                        were banned. In 2008 salilda.com decided to record 12 of these songs and this collection is now
                        available. The principal
                        singers are the members of IPTA and students of Rabindra Bharati University. It took us two
                        years to complete this
                        project. If you are interested in obtaining a copy of this collection please write to me. The
                        album can now be ordered
                        from Shubha Mudgel's site <span

                        marketed and distributed in India by UD Industries

                    <p class="text-textColor texts-size margin-three">
                        Recently Kolkata's most popular newspaper Anandabazar Patrika and the equally popular magazine
                        Anandalok published two
                        articles discussing salilda.com. It was good to see that 10 years after the launch of this
                        website the West Bengal press
                        has suddenly woken up and has taken notice. As a result I have been inundated with emails from
                        many admirers of Salilda.
                        Unfortunately in the Anandalok article our last 8 years hard work of collecting and trying to
                        publish Salilda's
                        unreleased songs from the '40s and '50s has been strongly critisized by some people. That is
                        really sad. The journalists
                        of both these publications have very kindly sent me the articles and I have decided to make them
                        available for you all
                        to read. Let me know what you think.
